# Introduction

Pashmak is a framework with focus on business logic by abstracting as many parts as needed. It is an ideal framework where you want to focus on readable code without worrying how under lying parts of the system work. This makes Pashmak an ideal framework for new solutions where you want to deliver a workable demo and use the same demo for long term maintenance.
